## [Ask a question](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/ama/issues/new) 
I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

If you want some **private communication** with me, you should encrypt your **message** using PGP and post it as public question to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/ama/issues). This is relatively easy using [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io).

### Guidelines 
- Ensure your question hasn't [already been answered](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)

## [Read questions](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
Make your day, drinking your morning coffee and joining the discussions, be polite.

### At keybase
I'm [tunnckocore](https://keybase.io/tunnckocore) on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io)!

```bash
