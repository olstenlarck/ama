# tunnckoCore/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from 
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and seems like a pretty fantastic 
idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, chat, and the like.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off 
[asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Ask a question
Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/feedback/issues/new) on this
project. Or come in [chat room](https://gitter.im/tunnckoCore/feedback) of this repo for live chat!

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions
Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
