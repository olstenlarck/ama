Instead of sending me email use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/messages/issues) to send me messages.

To send me a **private message** you should encrypt it using PGP and post it as an issue to the issue tracker. This is relatively easy using [keybase.io](https://keybase.io). 

I'm [tunnckocore](https://keybase.io/tunnckocore) on keybase!

## Using Keybase.io
Consider the [keybase command line program](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line).
```bash
# look me up
keybase id tunnckocore

# encrypt a message to me
keybase encrypt tunnckocore -m 'send me a secret message...'
keybase encrypt tunnckocore foobar.png  # send me a file

# ...and more... https://keybase.io
```

## Ask a question
Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue][new-message-url] on this
project. Or come in [chat room][chatroom-url] of this repo for live chat!

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.


## Read before write
Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
