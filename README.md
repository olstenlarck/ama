_Instead of sending me email use the **[issue tracker](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/messages/issues)** to send me messages._

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off 
[asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.


## Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue][new-message-url] on this
project. Or come in [chat room][chatroom-url] of this repo for live chat!

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.


## Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
